## Drivers and software
The USB device behaves as a standard HID device, so you do not need non-standard drivers. It also allows control of devices in the I2C system bus.

In case of Linux the drivers are available in kernel. Therefore the module creates the system-wide I2C bus. 


## Usage

The functional examples are available in [pymblab](https://github.com/MLAB-project/pymlab) control library. The details are available on [MLAB wiki](https://wiki.mlab.cz/doku.php?id=en:usbi2c)
